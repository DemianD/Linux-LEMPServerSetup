# Set up ftp
All the users can sign in with their password and have access only to their own home directory.

We will remove write access in de root home directory of the user.
Removing the write permission on the root isnâ€™t a perfect solution as doing this can cause a few problems with things that need to write to the root directory, such as the bash history file or some graphical environments.

It's important to make a new account, with a home directory without write access.

- useradd ftp_user
- passwd ftp_user
