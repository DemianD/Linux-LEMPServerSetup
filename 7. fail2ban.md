# fail2ban
- sudo apt-get install fail2ban

## Configuration
The path of the configurationfile is: ```/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf```

Every .conf file can be overridden with a file named .local. The .conf file is read first, then .local, with later settings overriding earlier ones. Thus, a .local file doesn't have to include everything in the corresponding .conf file, only those settings that you wish to override.

- touch /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

### Whitelist your IP-address
It's a good habit to add your home/office IP-address. Make sure this IP-address is a static IP-address. 

- sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

```diff
- ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8
+ ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 123.45.67.89
```

### Using UFW firewall instead of iptables-multiport
Since we are using ufw as firewall, we'll set the banaction to ufw instead of iptables-multiport

```diff
- banaction = iptables-multiport
+ banaction = ufw
```

Change ufw in action.d

```
[Definition]
actionstart =
actionstop =
actioncheck =
actionban = ufw insert 1 deny from <ip>
actionunban = ufw delete deny from <ip>
```

### Change PORT of SSH
Because we are using a different SSH port, we need to set this up in the fail2ban config:

```diff
[sshd]

- port = ssh
+ port = 47222
logpath = %(sshd_log)s
```
